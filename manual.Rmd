Subject: Survey Reminder

Hi,

This is the DevPsy Lab! We noticed you started to complete our SONA survey, Developing a Novel Measure of Behavior, but did not finish it. We were wondering whether you wanted to complete the survey and receive the full 2 points of extra credit, or whether you wanted to stop and receive partial extra credit. Please do let us know! If you do not reply within 2 days, we will grant you partial credit and you will not be able to finish the survey.
Your survey link is: [INSERT]
For privacy reasons, we have not included your return code; please do let us know if you need it.

Thank you!

  - If participants do not respond after two days, mark them as an excused absence and grant them partial credit.
    - Grant a point for every hour participants spent completing the survey, rounded up to the nearest 0.5.
